# MoS2CAP
This repository accompanies the manuscript "Electrolyte Hydration Energy as a Universal Descriptor for Ion-Specific Capacitance". It provides code, data, and analysis tools to reproduce the interpretable machine learning framework for predicting and understanding the capacitance of 2D MoSâ‚‚ supercapacitors.
